# Bulk Image Generator

Generates images in bulk from a YAML prompt list using **Nano Banana 2** (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`) via the Google AI Studio API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) API key

Install uv:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install dependencies with uv:

```bash
uv pip install google-genai pyyaml
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Use the default prompts.yaml in the same folder
python bulk_image_gen.py

# Point to a specific prompts file
python bulk_image_gen.py my_batch.yaml

# Use a separate prefix file (overrides prefix_file set inside the YAML)
python bulk_image_gen.py my_batch.yaml --prefix my_prefix.yaml
```

When run, the script will prompt you to paste your Google AI Studio API key (input is hidden). To skip the prompt, set it as an environment variable instead:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python bulk_image_gen.py
```

## Prompts YAML format

The prompts file has three top-level keys:

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `output_dir` | no | Folder to save images to. Defaults to `./output` |
| `prefix_file` | no | Path to a prefix YAML or .txt file (see below) |
| `prompts` | **yes** | List of prompt entries |

Each entry in `prompts` can be either a plain string or a mapping with these fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | **yes** | The subject text sent to the model |
| `label` | no | Filename prefix. Auto-generated from the prompt if omitted |

### Minimal example

```yaml
output_dir: "output"

prompts:
  - prompt: "Subject: Broom of Flying"
  - prompt: "Subject: Decanter of Endless Water"
  - prompt: "Subject: Trusty Steed"
```

### With labels

```yaml
output_dir: "output"

prompts:
  - label: broom
    prompt: "Subject: Broom of Flying"

  - label: decanter
    prompt: "Subject: Decanter of Endless Water"
```

### With a prefix file

```yaml
output_dir: "output"
prefix_file: "prefix.yaml"

prompts:
  - prompt: "Subject: Broom of Flying"
  - prompt: "Subject: Decanter of Endless Water"
```

## Prefix file

A prefix is a block of descriptive text prepended to every prompt. Use it to set a consistent style, medium, lighting, or framing across your whole batch — like a "system prompt" for image generation.

The prefix and subject are combined like this before being sent to the model:

```
<prefix text>

Subject: Broom of Flying
```

The prefix file can be either a `.yaml` file with a `prefix:` key, or a plain `.txt` file.

### prefix.yaml example

```yaml
prefix: >
  Fantasy trading card illustration style. Painterly detail, rich jewel-toned
  colors, dark vignette border, dramatic studio lighting. The image depicts a
  single magical item floating against a deep black background. Render it with
  museum-quality realism — visible brushwork, aged patina, subtle arcane glow.
  No text, no labels, no people.
```

### prefix.txt example

```
Fantasy trading card illustration style. Painterly detail, rich jewel-toned
colors, dark vignette border, dramatic studio lighting. The image depicts a
single magical item floating against a deep black background. Render it with
museum-quality realism — visible brushwork, aged patina, subtle arcane glow.
No text, no labels, no people.
```

You can also pass the prefix file on the command line with `--prefix`, which overrides any `prefix_file` set inside the YAML:

```bash
python bulk_image_gen.py magic_items.yaml --prefix dark_fantasy.yaml
python bulk_image_gen.py magic_items.yaml --prefix watercolor.txt
```

---

## Output

Images are saved to the `output_dir` folder with filenames in this format:

```
001_broom_of_flying.png
002_decanter_of_endless_water.png
003_trusty_steed.png
```

The numeric prefix keeps them sorted in the order they appear in the YAML.

---

## File layout

```
bulk_image_gen.py   ← bulk image generation script
decompose_maps.py   ← D&D map transcription script
prompts.yaml        ← your prompt list
prefix.yaml         ← optional style/prefix block
output/             ← generated images saved here
```

# D&D Map Decomposer

Batch-transcribes one-page D&D dungeon maps (PDF, PNG, or JPEG) into Markdown using **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** with medium reasoning and streamed thinking summaries.

## Usage

```bash
# Process every PDF/PNG/JPEG in a folder
python decompose_maps.py /path/to/maps

# Reprocess even when a matching .md already exists
python decompose_maps.py /path/to/maps --force

# Write Markdown elsewhere and keep logs in a custom folder
python decompose_maps.py /path/to/maps --output-dir ./transcripts --log-dir ./transcripts/logs
```

Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to skip the interactive key prompt:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python decompose_maps.py /path/to/maps
```

## What it does

For each map file, the script:

1. Sends the file plus this prompt to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` at **medium** thinking level:
   > I have here a one page D&D dungeon concept. Start by describing the page, then transcribe all the written text, then describe the map with enough detail for someone who can't see it to play.
2. Streams the response, capturing both thinking summaries and final text.
3. Writes `<map_name>.md` beside the source file (or into `--output-dir`).
4. If output is blocked (safety, token limit, prompt block, etc.), records the block reason and any partial thinking/text, then continues to the next map.

## Output

| Artifact | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown transcript | `<map_name>.md` | Thinking (if streamed), transcription, and block notes |
| Per-map log | `logs/<map_name>.log` | Detailed send/stream/receive timeline for that file |
| Session log | `logs/decompose_session_<timestamp>.log` | Batch summary across all maps |

Existing `.md` files are skipped unless you pass `--force`.
